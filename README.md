In this repository I gather my algorithms using in competitive programming.The repo contains:	
*Dijkstra algorithm-searching the fastest path in directed graph.
*Hash algo-can be used to hash some words and fasten string problems i CP.
*Lazy_propagation-the fastest algorithm to do an update and query on the sections.
*LCA-algo to find the lowest common ancestor.
*Segment tree-simple segment tree to do an update in point and queryon section.
*Shortest path-findind the shorthest path in graph.
*size subtree- counting the size of the subtree.
*topology sorting- linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
